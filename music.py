Everyone likes listening to music; you can also create your music player app.
Other than playing music, your program can explore your file directories and search for music.
This is one of the creative python projects you might face is creating an interactive interface that can be used by regular users.

The app will have a neat interface that will allow users to browse through tracks, increase/decrease volume, display the name of the song, artist, album.
This project will mainly involve the basics of Python programming, database management, algorithm construction, and data processing
