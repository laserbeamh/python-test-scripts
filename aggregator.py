#The internet is filled with websites, articles, and information.
#When we want to find something, it is tough to go through each of them.
#For this use, you can create a content aggregator that automatically searches popular websites and looks for relevant content and then complies with all the content and lets the user choose which content they want.
#It is very much like Google but unbiased.
#And this is the perfect idea for your next python project!
